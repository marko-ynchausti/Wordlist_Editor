This tool helps for creating modified wordlists for password cracking capture the flag events.

I am creating a tool that allows a user to make modifications to existing wordlist files for password cracking. In the password cracking portion of a capture the flag event, you need to create wordlists to try and guess a user’s password. Since wordlists contain thousands of possible lines, it is impossible to modify them without making a tool to help with the repetitiveness of manually changing every line on the wordlist to match a certain criteria. The criteria includes: uppercasing/lowercasing the first letter of every word on the file, replacing a space with an underscore, a dash, or deleting a space to have the words combined. The problem to solve is automating the wordlist editing process for efficiency. The input data are the user’s commands that they want to make to the wordlist, and the existing wordlist file. The program will display a portion of the wordlist and ask the user’s input for what modifications will the user want to make such as replacing spaces with underscores or deleting spaces. After the program receives the users input, it will open the existing wordlist file, make the modifications and output a new modified file. This streamlines the process of creating new wordlists to try and guess passwords.
